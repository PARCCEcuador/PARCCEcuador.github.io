						<h4>The Project</h4>
					<p>The Proyecto Arqueológico de los Ríos Culebra-Colín (PARCC) is an archaeological research project working in collaboration with the <em>comuna</em> Dos Mangas. PARCC’s geographic foci are the lands alongside the Culebra and Colín Rivers, comprising the upper watershed of the Manglaralto Valley, and the lands of the comuna. This area has evidence for the entirety of the Ecuadorian pre-Hispanic coastal sequence and as such is a rich ground to explore culture change through time. The goals of PARCC are to carry out research-driven archaeological investigations, assist with salvage excavations of archaeological remains within the study area when possible, and engage local community members in projects that raise the visibility of local cultural heritage and advocate for its conservation.</p>

					<h4>Who We Are</h4>
					<b>Sarah M. Rowe, Project Director</b>
					<p>I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. I specialize in anthropological archaeology and cultural heritage studies. My research interests include South American archaeology (specifically Ecuador), critical cultural heritage, and collaborative community research. I specialize in the archaeology of coastal Ecuador, particularly in the ceramic technology of pre-Columbian peoples. My research has spanned the Formative (4400-1400 BC) through the Integration Periods (800-1532 AD). I am interested in the development of social complexity and regional identities on the coast from the introduction of agriculture to Conquest, in both a local perspective and comparatively to the cultural manifestations in the central Andes. I received my PhD from the University of Illinois in 2014.</p>
